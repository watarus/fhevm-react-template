# Video Walkthrough Script - Universal FHEVM SDK

**Duration**: 5-7 minutes
**Target Audience**: Web3 developers, FHEVM enthusiasts, Zama bounty reviewers

---

## 🎬 Scene 1: Introduction (30 seconds)

**[Screen: GitHub repository homepage]**

**Narrator**:
> "Hi! Today I'm excited to show you the Universal FHEVM SDK - a game-changing toolkit that makes building confidential dApps with Fully Homomorphic Encryption incredibly easy.
>
> I've built a framework-agnostic SDK that works with React, Vue, and vanilla JavaScript - all from a single, elegant core."

**[Highlight]: Repository stars, forks**

## 🎬 Scene 2: The Problem & Solution (45 seconds)

**[Screen: Split screen showing old vs new code]**

**Narrator**:
> "Before this SDK, working with FHEVM required manual instance management, complex encryption setup, and lots of boilerplate code.
>
> **[Point to left side]** Here's the old way - you had to create instances manually, pass them everywhere, and handle all the lifecycle yourself.
>
> **[Point to right side]** With the Universal SDK, it's just 10 lines of code. The SDK handles everything: automatic lifecycle, event-driven architecture, and built-in signature management."

**[Show code comparison]**:
```typescript
// OLD WAY (left)
const instance = await createInstance(...);
// Pass instance everywhere, manual setup

// NEW WAY (right)
const { instance, status } = useFhevm({ network, chainId });
// Automatic lifecycle, just use it!
```

## 🎬 Scene 3: Architecture Overview (60 seconds)

**[Screen: Architecture diagram animation]**

**Narrator**:
> "The magic is in the architecture. At the core, we have a framework-agnostic client built with an EventEmitter pattern.
>
> **[Highlight Core layer]**
> This core handles all the FHEVM complexity - connecting, encryption, decryption - and emits events when things happen.
>
> **[Highlight React layer]**
> React hooks subscribe to these events and provide a Wagmi-style API that Web3 developers already know and love.
>
> **[Highlight Vue layer]**
> Vue composables do the same thing using Vue 3's Composition API.
>
> **[Highlight Framework-agnostic option]**
> And if you're using something else - Angular, Svelte, even vanilla JS - you can use the core directly.
>
> It's one codebase, three ways to use it."

**[Show diagram]**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│   React Hooks   │  Vue Composables  │
│   useFhevm()    │   useFhevm()      │
├─────────────────┴───────────────────┤
│    Framework-Agnostic Core          │
│    EventEmitter + FhevmClient       │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤

└─────────────────────────────────────┘

## 🎬 Scene 4: Live Demo - React (90 seconds)

**[Screen: localhost:3000 showing NEW API demo]**

**Narrator**:
> "Let me show you how it works. Here's our live demo running locally.
>
> **[Point to top section]**
> This is the NEW API demo. Notice the clean, modern UI with the green 'NEW API' badge.
>
> **[Click Connect Wallet]**
> First, I'll connect MetaMask. **[MetaMask popup appears]** Just one click...
>
> **[Status changes to 'ready']**
> And we're connected! The SDK automatically initialized the FHEVM instance. See the status went from 'connecting' to 'ready' - all handled by the `useFhevm()` hook.
>
> **[Hover over code section if shown]**
> Behind the scenes, this is just:
> ```typescript
> const { instance, status } = useFhevm({ network, chainId });
> ```
>
> **[Point to counter display]**
> Now let's interact with the FHE Counter contract. The current value is encrypted - you can see the handle here.
>
> **[Click Decrypt]**
> When I click decrypt, the SDK automatically:
> - Checks if we have a valid signature
> - Requests one from MetaMask if needed
> - Decrypts the value
> - Caches the signature for future use
>
> **[Value appears]**
> There we go! The decrypted value is 0. All of that with one function call:
> ```typescript
> const { decrypt, results } = useDecrypt({ instance, signer, requests });
> ```
>
> **[Click Increment]**
> Let's increment the counter. **[MetaMask pops up]** Signing the transaction...
>
> **[Transaction confirms]**
> Done! The value is now encrypted again. The SDK handled the encryption using the builder pattern:
> ```typescript
> await encrypt((input) => input.add64(1));
> ```

## 🎬 Scene 5: Code Comparison (60 seconds)

**[Screen: Split screen - NEW API vs Legacy code]**

**Narrator**:
> "Now compare this to the legacy implementation below.
>
> **[Scroll to bottom half]**
> This is the old API - same functionality, but look at the difference:
>
> **[Highlight complexity]**
> - Manual instance creation
> - No automatic status tracking
> - Complex encryption setup
> - Manual signature management
>
> **[Scroll back to NEW API]**
> With the new SDK, all of that is handled for you. It's not just cleaner code - it's more maintainable, more testable, and less prone to bugs.
>
> **[Show API comparison card]**
> And here's a comparison card I built right into the demo showing all the improvements."

---

## 🎬 Scene 6: Vue Support Demo (45 seconds)

**[Screen: Code editor showing Vue component]**

**Narrator**:
> "And here's the really cool part - the same API works in Vue!
>
> **[Show Vue code]**
> ```vue
> <script setup>
> const { instance, status } = useFhevm({ network, chainId });
> const { encrypt, canEncrypt } = useEncrypt({ instance, signer });
> </script>
> ```
>
> Same hook names, same parameters, just Vue composables instead of React hooks. We're using Vue 3's Composition API with refs and computed properties.
>
> **[Highlight key points]**
> The core is doing all the heavy lifting - the wrappers just adapt to each framework's patterns."

---

## 🎬 Scene 7: Technical Highlights (45 seconds)

**[Screen: Terminal showing build output]**

**Narrator**:
> "Let's talk about the technical implementation.
>
> **[Show build command]**
> When we build the SDK, we generate 34 separate files:
> - 14 for the core
> - 8 for React
> - 8 for Vue
> - Plus storage utilities
>
> **[Show TypeScript compilation]**
> Full TypeScript support with zero errors. Every function is documented with JSDoc.
>
> **[Show import paths]**
> And we use multiple entry points for optimal tree-shaking:
> ```typescript
> import { useFhevm } from '@fhevm-sdk/react';   // React
> import { useFhevm } from '@fhevm-sdk/vue';     // Vue
> import { createFhevmClient } from '@fhevm-sdk/core';  // Core
> ```
>
> Your bundle only includes what you use."

---

## 🎬 Scene 8: Migration Story (30 seconds)

**[Screen: MIGRATION.md document]**

**Narrator**:
> "What about existing FHEVM projects?
>
> **[Show migration guide]**
> I've written a complete migration guide. The best part? The new SDK is 100% backward compatible.
>
> **[Show code]**
> Your old code still works:
> ```typescript
> useFhevm({ provider, initialMockChains })  // Old API works
> ```
>
> But you can gradually migrate to:
> ```typescript
> useFhevm({ network, mockChains })  // New API
> ```
>
> No breaking changes, just opt-in improvements."

---

## 🎬 Scene 9: Package Structure (30 seconds)

**[Screen: File explorer showing project structure]**

**Narrator**:
> "The project is organized as a monorepo with three packages:
>
> **[Expand packages/fhevm-sdk]**
> The SDK package with core, React, and Vue implementations.
>
> **[Expand packages/nextjs]**
> A Next.js demo app showing both APIs.
>
> **[Expand packages/hardhat]**
> And Hardhat for the smart contracts.
>
> **[Show package.json exports]**
> Everything is TypeScript-first with comprehensive documentation."

## 🎬 Scene 10: Real-World Benefits (45 seconds)

**[Screen: Benefits list with animations]**

**Narrator**:
> "Why does this matter?
>
> **1. Developer Experience**
> Getting started with FHEVM goes from hours to minutes. 10 lines of code and you're ready.
>
> **2. Maintainability**
> Event-driven architecture means less spaghetti code and better separation of concerns.
>
> **3. Framework Flexibility**
> Build with React today, migrate to Vue tomorrow - your FHEVM logic stays the same.
>
> **4. Production Ready**
> Automatic signature caching, staleness detection, error handling - all built in.
>
> **5. Type Safety**
> Full TypeScript support catches bugs before they reach production."

---

## 🎬 Scene 11: Deployment (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Vercel dashboard]**

**Narrator**:
> "Deployment is just as easy.
>
> **[Show vercel.json]**
> I've configured everything for Vercel with proper monorepo support.
>
> **[Show deployment in progress]**
> Push to GitHub, Vercel automatically:
> - Installs dependencies
> - Builds the SDK
> - Builds the Next.js app
> - Deploys to the edge
>
> **[Show live URL]**
> And you get a live demo URL you can share immediately."

---

## 🎬 Scene 12: Documentation (30 seconds)

**[Screen: README.md on GitHub]**

**Narrator**:

> - Quick start guides for all frameworks
> - Migration guide from old API
> - Deployment guide for Vercel
> - Troubleshooting section
>
> **[Show CHANGELOG]**
